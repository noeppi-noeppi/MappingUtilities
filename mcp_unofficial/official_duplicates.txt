Duplicates with official mappings.

This contains a list of mappings that are the same here as in the official mappings with
a short sentence on why this name was chosen.


field_216082_a    Condition array. The name conditions is used for this in MCP names at other places as well.
field_229020_a_   Named `markers` because its a map with all current markers (it maps block positions to markers).
field_229024_a_   Contains the color of the marker. This is known because there are methods to extract red green blue and alpha parts which are used in func_229023_a_ (renderMarker) for color parameters.
field_233605_i_   This field is named `updateInterval` as it's set by the method func_233608_b_ (updateInterval).
field_236084_w_   Seed field retrieved from the codec.
field_236145_a_   Codec fields are also named `CODEC` everywhere in the MCP names.
field_236164_i_   Density Offset field retrieved from the codec.
field_236183_b_   Target field retrieved from the codec.
field_236184_c_   Size field retrieved from the codec.
field_236185_d_   Offset field retrieved from the codec.
field_236190_a_   Codec fields are also named `CODEC` everywhere in the MCP names.
field_236656_a_   Codec fields are also named `CODEC` everywhere in the MCP names.
field_236657_b_   Distance field retrieved from the codec.
field_236658_c_   Spread field retrieved from the codec.
field_236659_d_   Count field retrieved from the codec.
field_236664_a_   Codec fields are also named `CODEC` everywhere in the MCP names.
field_236665_b_   Spacing field retrieved from the codec.
field_236666_c_   Separation field retrieved from the codec.
field_236667_d_   Salt field retrieved from the codec.
field_242287_aj   Name of entity type (PIGLIN_BRUTE) found from string argument to the register method used to assign it.
field_244549_a    Logger field for a class is named `LOGGER`.
func_213416_eg    Gets whether the cat is lying (in the appropriate goals: CatLieOnBedGoal and MorningGiftGoal). Like other data manager properties, the getter and setter method are named by beans convention.
func_213419_u     Controls whether the cat is lying (in the appropriate goals: CatLieOnBedGoal and MorningGiftGoal). Like other data manager properties, the getter and setter method are named by beans convention.
func_213480_dY    Used only by the PounceGoal class. The fox flag is true while the goal is running (meaning the fox is in the process of pouncing.)
func_213503_w     Lerps between fields field_213521_bO (crouchAmountO) and field_213520_bN (crouchAmount). Because these fields are named like this, this is named `getCrouchAmount`.
func_213539_dW    The matching setter sets the sneeze counter to 0 (via func_213562_s) which implies this is a getter for whether the panda is sneezing.
func_213556_dX    The matching setter is called with `true` as argument in `tryToSit`. That means this flag is the sitting flag and thus the getter is named `isSitting`.
func_213564_eh    The matching setter is called in RollGoal to be true whenever the RollGoal is active. This means this is the flag for whether the panda is rolling with a getter in beans style being `isRolling`.
func_213578_dZ    Checks whether field_213594_bD (EAT_COUNTER) is greater than zero which means the panda is eating. This gives the name `isEating`.
func_216079_f     Getter for field_216082_a (conditions)
func_221107_c     True for each recessive gene. The name `recessive` comes from the minecraft wiki.
func_225422_a     `build` method in builder class.
func_226511_et_   Getter for the attack damage attribute is named `getAttackDamage`.
func_226517_es_   Getter for the attack damage attribute is named `getAttackDamage`.
func_229023_a_    This method is called for each marker and calls render methods. As it redners one marker it was named `renderMarker`
func_234422_eK_   This method (canHunt) is used in conditions for setting the memory value field_234082_P_ (HUNTED_RECENTLY) which has its name from the identifier string used when its registered.
func_234425_eN_   Bean style getter for data manager property `DANCING`
func_234442_u_    Bean style setter for data manager property `DANCING`
func_234451_A_    The method only gets the memory `ADMIRING_ITEM`. It is named `isAdmiringItem` by beans convention.
func_236181_l_    Amplified getter method retrieved from the codec.
func_242335_eK    Bean styled getter for property `immuneToZombification`. Name is derived from the read and write methods as it is used in the NBT.
func_242340_t     Bean styled setter for property `immuneToZombification`. Name is derived from the read and write methods as it is used in the NBT.
func_243531_h     `move` is used for other actions to move the mutable blockpos a certain way in MCP names. This name was chosen to keep this consistent.
func_244709_b     The result of this assigned to field_214963_f (protocolVersion) in 1.16.5. The name is derived from that field name.
